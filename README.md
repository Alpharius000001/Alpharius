# ALPHARIUS PROTOCOL  
*We are many. We are one.*

> A decentralized resistance network for those who refuse to be watched.

---

## 🧠 Mission

Alpharius is an open-source protocol built to detect, disrupt, and devalue mass surveillance.  
We are not building another privacy tool. We are weaponizing decentralization, collective intelligence, and encrypted automation to turn passive data subjects into active digital dissidents.

This project is part infrastructure, part resistance network, part digital mythology.

We don’t want your name.  
We want your skill, your courage, and your conviction.

## 🕶️ What We're Building

- **RedactBot** — automated FOIA + DSR tooling for mass data deletion
- **Neural Citadel** — a gamified privacy skill tree and contributor dashboard
- **Alpharius DAO** — resistance pods governed by the people, not platforms
- **Encrypted Ops Stack** — Matrix, Oxen, Signal, IPFS and beyond

Join a pod. Build a tool. Burn a tracker.

## 💀 I Am Alpharius

Everyone in this project shares one name: **Alpharius**.  
We operate pseudonymously, assign numeric tags, and reject clout-based hierarchies.

- No ego.
- No followers.
- No fame.
- Just code, protocol, and purpose.

Decentralize everything

Move in pods, not pyramids

Encryption is non-negotiable

Tools are more powerful than takes

Never build surveillance infrastructure, even accidentally

✊ Call to Coders, Hackers, Designers & Dreamers
If you’ve ever whispered this system isn't right
If you've ever deleted an app with a bad feeling in your gut
If you're ready to fight—not just post—this is your call.

You are Alpharius.
See you in the Citadel.
